# Nutrition & COVID-19 (Does Diet Matter in fighting Pandemic?)

This is a case study explores the statistical analysis of dietary habits of an individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Introduction:

This study explores the relationship between energy intake (units = kcal) from various nutritional indicators (e.g., animal products, Vegetable products, cereals, and obesity rates) and the percentage of confirmed COVID-19 cases across regions. 

By employing a multiple linear regression model, it investigates how energy intake from these dietary sources correlate with infection rates, providing insights to inform public health strategies and enhance resilience against infectious diseases.

Representation of MLR model : Confirmed(%) = β0 + β1(Alcoholic_Beverages) + β2(Animal _fats) + β3(Cereals) + β4(Eggs) + β5(Seafood) + β6(Milk) + β7(Offals) + β8(Stimulants) + β9(Treenuts) + β10(Vegetal_Products) + β11(Obesity)
